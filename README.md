Run Super Mario Kart natively on Windows.



> **You must legally own a copy of the game.** No ROM data is distributed with
> this project, in the repository or in any release. The recompiled C is
> generated locally from your own copy and is never committed.

## ☕ Keep the ports coming

**This project is free and always will be.** Every port in this series,
Super Mario Kart included, is built with many hours of AI-assisted reverse engineering,
and that AI time is paid. If you enjoy playing it, a coffee at
**[buymeacoffee.com/mpolizel](https://buymeacoffee.com/mpolizel)** keeps the AI running so **more SNES
games can be ported to native Recomp**. Any amount helps, and thank you!

## Download (ready-to-run Windows build)

Get the latest `supermariokart-<version>-windows-x64.zip` from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/mpolizel/SMKSNESRecomp/releases/latest).

The zip is a **setup pack**: it contains the launcher, the recompiler and this
source tree, but no game data. On first run:

1. Unzip anywhere and start `SuperMarioKartSNESRecomp.exe`.
2. Let it download the portable build tools (one time per machine), or point
   it at a `cmake-clang-v1` zip you already have.
3. Pick your own `Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc` (CRC32 `cd80db86`).
4. Press **Generate & rebuild**. The playable game is built into `build/` and
   started; run it from there afterwards.

[RecompLauncher](https://recomplauncher.com) can install it too: the release
carries a `recomplauncher.json`, so the launcher asks for your ROM, builds the
game on its own setup screen (no window of ours), and Play goes straight into
the game. The window, renderer, shader, picture and sound settings are on the
game's page, and Big Picture mode opens it full screen. RecompLauncher keeps
the game up to date itself, so the game's own update check steps aside when
the launcher starts it; started any other way, it checks as before.

In the launcher, **Settings → Shader** lists the scanline, CRT and upscaler
presets; choosing one switches the renderer to OpenGL automatically. A fresh
install starts with no shader (the plain picture), the lightest option for
any graphics card; pick a CRT or upscaler preset there if yours has room.
Your choice is saved in `config.ini` and kept. The upscalers include
**ScaleFX** and the neural **NNEDI3** presets.

During play, **Ctrl+L** (or **Select+L3** on a controller) reopens the
launcher: shader, window scale, volume and controls apply when you press
**Resume**, without restarting the game. **I** cycles the audio interpolation
between **Gaussian** (the console's own, the default), **Cubic** (crisper
highs) and **Sinc**; it only changes what you hear, never the game, and the
choice is saved in `audio_interpolation.txt`.

On laptops with two graphics cards (NVIDIA Optimus, AMD switchable graphics)
the game asks the driver for the dedicated one. If it still runs slowly,
set the game's executable to **High performance** in Windows Settings →
System → Display → Graphics.

### Updates

With **Check for updates on start** ticked (the default; on the launcher's main
screen, next to **Skip launcher on boot**), the game
asks GitHub for the latest release when it starts and offers to install a
newer one. Accepting closes the game, downloads the new setup pack, copies it
over the install folder and reopens the setup window: press **Generate &
rebuild**. Nothing is deleted; `build\` (the rebuilt game, `saves\`, save
states, `config.ini`, `keybinds.ini`) and `rom.cfg` are kept.
Untick the box to turn the check off (saved in `update.ini`).

**Your saves are never lost or broken by an update.** In-game saves and save states made by
any earlier release keep working in every later one. Before installing, the
updater copies `build\saves\` to `save-backups\<date>_before_<version>\` and
never deletes those copies; save files are left out of the copy, and if they
changed anyway the backup is put back. Every release is checked against the
one before it with `tools/check_update_compat.ps1`, which builds the previous
release, makes an in-game save and a save state with it, installs the new pack with the previous
release's own updater and rebuilds; it fails unless every save file is
byte-identical and the new build continues the old save state.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each release.

## Status

Boots to the title screen and runs one- and two-player races (Mode 7 with
the DSP-1 command model, no firmware needed); the lower screen's track map,
rear-view mirror and second player show their sprites. Most code still runs
through the snesrecomp interpreter; full cups and Battle Mode are not yet
verified. See [Porting from here](#porting-from-here).

### Framework patches

`patches/` holds changes to the `snesrecomp` and `recomp-ui` submodules.
Reapply them after updating the submodules:

```sh
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-apu-first-read-timeline.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-audio-interpolation.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-glsl-passprev-and-vao.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-joypad-manual-strobe.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-mosaic-frame-model.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-nmi-idle-loop-wai.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-nmi-wai-in-handler.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-raster-oam-and-hdma.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-recomplauncher.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-resume-state-restart.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-shader-forces-opengl.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-state-load-raster-reset.patch
git -C snesrecomp apply ../patches/snesrecomp-v10-savestates.patch
git -C recomp-ui apply ../patches/recomp-ui-host-toggle.patch
```

`snesrecomp-raster-oam-and-hdma.patch` is the renderer fix shared with the
other ports. It also counts HDMA's first transfer, made in V=0's
H-blank, as a table line, as the hardware does. Every HDMA split landed one
line late without it (on Donkey Kong Country 2's island map the late layer
split drew a bright line across the screen).

`snesrecomp-audio-interpolation.patch` adds the Cubic and Sinc audio
interpolation (I key). They resample the dry output only; the echo buffer,
OUTX, pitch modulation and save states stay those of the console's Gaussian
filter, so the game runs identically in every mode.

`snesrecomp-glsl-passprev-and-vao.patch` fixes two shader bugs: a pass that
reads `PassPrev<n>` back to the game frame got nothing (ScaleFX drew black),
and switching to no shader mid-game drew a black screen because the shader
path left the plain path's vertex attributes disabled.

`snesrecomp-apu-first-read-timeline.patch` lets the sound chip run from power
on when the game reads its ports before writing them. Kirby Super Star read
the sound port once, right after the SA-1 finishes its start-up, and uploads
its sound driver only if the chip's boot ROM answers; the framework started
the sound chip's clock at the first port write, so the read found nothing and
the game waited forever on a black screen.

`snesrecomp-joypad-manual-strobe.patch` passes the manual-read strobe
($4016 write) to the controller. The reads already reached it, the strobe did
not, so a game that reads the pad by hand got its sixteen buttons once and then
every button held, for good. Bart's Nightmare reads the pad that way in the
doors and the nightmares: it chose a door by itself and, inside a nightmare,
fell into its pause screen and waited for a Start press that could never come
(the picture frozen, the music still playing).

`snesrecomp-mosaic-frame-model.patch` builds the mosaic table on every visible
line. The optimized renderer built it only on line 0, which frame-model hosts
never render, so every line of a mosaic-enabled layer sampled the layer's
first row.

`snesrecomp-nmi-idle-loop-wai.patch` and `snesrecomp-nmi-wai-in-handler.patch`
make a `WAI` halt until the next interrupt, as on hardware, in the main loop
and inside an interrupt handler; without them the interpreter could spin to
its step cap and freeze the screen.

`snesrecomp-resume-state-restart.patch` makes a setting that needs a restart
come back to the same moment. The in-game launcher saves `saves\resume.sav`,
restarts and loads it before the first frame, when no session exists yet. A
save state holds the machine but not the CPU half's registers or resume
point (a load during play keeps the session's own, the game's idle loop), so
the frame driver booted from the reset vector over it. The restart file is
now written in the rollback format (machine plus execution residue), and the
frame driver takes the interpreter's resume point at the start of a frame.
Save-state slots keep their format.

`snesrecomp-shader-forces-opengl.patch` switches the renderer to OpenGL when a
shader is picked, since the presets only run there.

`snesrecomp-state-load-raster-reset.patch` re-arms the raster journal when a
save state loads. The journal keeps the register file as the last field
started and puts it back before drawing, so after a load the previous scene's
BG mode, tilemaps and windows replaced the state's; a scene that sets them only
once (Bart's Nightmare's title, its doors) stayed garbled until it changed.

This project also saves the CPU's place in each save state
(`src/game_rtl.c`): the memory alone does not say where the CPU was, and a
load resumed at the running session's place, so a state loaded during
another scene (a cutscene, a menu) ran that scene's code over the state's
memory and went off the rails. A state from an earlier release still loads
as before.

`snesrecomp-v10-savestates.patch` keeps every save state players already
have. The framework's current access-exact SPC/DSP timing writes v11 states
and refused the v10 ones every earlier release wrote. With this patch a v10
state loads again: the APU's timer/DSP advance debt and the SPC's access
cursor start at zero (a v10 state always stands at an opcode boundary), the
per-clock S-DSP is rebuilt from the old model's voices (BRR block, position
and interpolation window, envelope, echo history), and an older execution
chunk converts to the current one. A save state made in 0.1.4 resumes where
it was made, with the music playing on.

`snesrecomp-recomplauncher.patch` follows RecompLauncher's recommendations:
`--prepare` builds the game from the ROM with no window, printing progress
lines (the launcher's setup step); started by RecompLauncher
(`RECOMPLAUNCHER=1`) the setup opens the built game straight on the ROM
instead of its own window, and in Big Picture mode
(`RECOMPLAUNCHER_MODE=bigpicture`) full screen; controllers are no longer
read while the window is in the background (`[General] BackgroundInput = 1`
turns that back on). Without those arguments and variables nothing changes.

`recomp-ui-host-toggle.patch` lets a title add one checkbox of its own beside
"Skip launcher on boot"; this project uses it for the update check.

The second fixes the split screen. The game uploads a second sprite table
(OAM) at its mid-screen split and the renderer, which draws after the CPU
frame, used the last table for every line: the lower screen lost its map
icons, mirror and second-player sprites. The renderer now keeps each OAM
table with the beam line it takes effect on. It also files a display write
made in the first half of a line with the line before it (the split's
force-blank write jitters across a line start, which made the last line of
each half flicker), but never across the start of vblank, whose writes
belong to the next frame; and it initializes HDMA channels enabled in vblank before line 1
(the top two lines showed the previous frame's road).

## ROM identity

| Publisher | — |

| Year | — |
| Mapping | hirom |

`tools/regen.sh` refuses to run against anything else, so a mismatched
revision fails immediately instead of producing subtly wrong output.

## Build

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
bash tools/regen.sh --rom /path/to/Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

The ROM does not have to live in the repository — keeping it on your own
drive is the better habit, and `SNESRECOMP_ROM` sets the path once for a
shell. Without either, `tools/regen.sh` finds `Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc` at the repo root,
then the path the setup wizard recorded in `rom.cfg`; `.gitignore` blocks
both from ever being committed.

`tools/regen.sh` verifies the ROM, generates `src/gen/*.c`, and re-syncs
`recomp/funcs.h`. Re-run it whenever you change anything under `recomp/`.

## Run

```sh
./build/SuperMarioKartSNESRecomp                     # launcher picks the ROM
./build/SuperMarioKartSNESRecomp /path/to/Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc # or name it and skip the launcher
```

With no ROM on the command line the build opens the recomp-ui launcher: a ROM
picker with a verification badge, plus display / audio / input settings. Your
choice is cached in `rom.cfg` beside the executable, so the next launch opens
on it and "Skip launcher on boot" makes it immediate. If the launcher is not
built in (`--no-recomp-ui`), the host falls back to a native file picker.

Either way the ROM is checked against the digests above before anything boots
— a dump that could not have produced this build is refused at the door rather
than mis-executing ten frames in.

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `recomp/` | Analysis input: `bank*.cfg`, `symbols.toml`, generated `funcs.h` |
| `rom_identity.txt` | ROM digests — read by the build, `tools/regen.sh` and CI |
| `src/` | Host code you own: `main.c`, `game_rtl.c` |
| `src/gen/` | Generated C. Never committed — regenerate locally |
| `snesrecomp/` | Framework submodule (owns `lib/recomp-net`, `lib/retcomm-rbengine`) |
| `tools/` | `regen.sh` — the ROM → C pipeline |
| `scripts/` | `package_release.sh` — player-facing zip |
| `framework_pins.txt` | Exact framework commits this project was scaffolded against |

## Porting from here

The scaffold stops where the game-specific work starts. In rough order:

1. **Make it boot.** `src/game_rtl.c` holds the frame driver. It starts on
   the framework's beam-aligned driver (`snesrecomp/runner/src/beam_frame_driver.h`):
   one frame per PPU field, interrupts taken where the beam latches them,
   the field rasterized from the raster journal. A title whose main loop it
   does not fit replaces those calls with its own driver.
2. **Name things.** Add entries to `recomp/symbols.toml` as you identify
   routines, then re-run `tools/regen.sh`. Set `emit = true` to promote one
   into ahead-of-time analysis; leave it false to keep it interpreted.
   Regen synchronizes the marked blocks in each bank cfg, creating missing
   configs. Only proven variants become AOT code. See `recomp/README.md`.
3. **Resolve dispatch misses.** After every run, deal with unresolved
   indirect targets before anything else — they are the reason a port
   diverges, and they are cheap to fix early.
4. **Never synthesise a result** to get past uncovered code, and never edit
   `src/gen/` by hand. Fix the config or the framework and regenerate.

## Multiplayer

Two players, one controller per port.
